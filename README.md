# Introduction

This repository is our main gateway for LLM Engineers. It provides a roadmap and ressources to upskill for this role. It introduces you to our other repositories for this role.

LLM Engineers integrates LLM capabilities in ML products. They build, deploy, scale and maintain LLM capabilities in production environments.

This repo is stil a **Work In Progress**. But you can already enjoy it.
